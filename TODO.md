- [X] Create plot command
- [ ] Set dropout rate to multiple layers
- [X] Update readme file
- [X] Fix loss and accuracy plot
- [ ] Add multiple optimizer
- [X] improve training options

### Dense Network
- [X] Create loss and accuracy for each activation defined by the user
- [ ] Add dynamic derivative in backpropagation for errors other than softmax

### Conv Network
- [X] Fix max-pooling ``_unpooling`` method (original height and width are incorrect)
